All the code for the paper is included here, though all the data necessary is not included, owing to size issues. One may run into issues with the code, as the paths may need to be modified. Jupyter notebooks for Experiment 3A and 4 should replicate without issue.

Note that bcc.py and BayesCC.py are the same as the bclr.py code, but exist for backwards compatibility.
