All the code for the paper is included here, though all the data necessary to reproduce the results is not included, owing to size issues. One may run into issues with the code, as the paths may need to be modified. Jupyter notebooks for experiments in Section 4 of the paper should replicate without issue.

Files to run Experiment1.ipynb, Experiment2_Analysis.ipynb, or Experiment2_Prior_Kappa.ipynb without error can be provided upon request to Andrew M. Thomas (<andrew-thomas@uiowa.edu>). They are not provided here as they are too large.

The .csv files contain the data used for Section 5 (Applications) as well as the first two videos for Experiments 1 and 2 (prior to the 1000 simulated videos). Examples of the procedures used to derive the posterior distributions for kappa mentioned in the text can be seen in "bclr_examples.ipynb".
