A package for Bayesian Changepoint detection via Logistic Regression. Method wasdeveloped in Thomas, Jauch, and Matteson (2024)[](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02917)

## Information on the package

A brief tutorial can be seen in <code>bclr_examples.ipynb</code>. The experiments folder contains the code necessary to replicate some of our experiments. However, not all of the data is available for Experiments 1 and 2 because of size constraints. It can be made available upon request.
